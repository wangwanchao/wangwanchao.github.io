java.util.COllection是一个集合接口，而java.util.Collections作为集合的工具类。

## Collection ##

List、Queue、Set接口都继承了Collection接口，Map接口没有实现Collection接口。

可以看到，Collection接口定义了一些基本操作的通用方法。


## Collections ##

Collections作为工具类，定义了很多静态方法，

	sort()						// 排序
	binarySearch()				// 二分查找
	reverse()					// 反转
	unmodifiableCollection()	// 不可修改
	synchronizedCollection()	// 同步
	singleton()					// 单例
